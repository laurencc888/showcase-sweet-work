# CS Portfolio — Implementation Plan

## Overview
A clean, minimal single-page portfolio for a senior CS student showcasing 5-8 projects, with a hero intro, about section, and social links.

---

## 1. Hero Section
- Your name and a short tagline (e.g., "Senior CS Student & Developer")
- Social links row: GitHub, LinkedIn, email icon
- Subtle scroll-down indicator

## 2. About Section
- Brief bio paragraph — your background, interests, and what you're looking for (internship, full-time, etc.)
- Optional: a small photo/avatar placeholder

## 3. Projects Section
- Grid of project cards (responsive: 1 column on mobile, 2-3 on desktop)
- Each card includes:
  - Project title
  - Short description
  - Tech stack tags (e.g., React, Python, etc.)
  - Links to live demo and/or GitHub repo
- 6 placeholder projects to start, easy to customize with your real projects

## 4. Footer
- Social links repeated (GitHub, LinkedIn, email)
- Simple copyright line

## Design Details
- Light, minimal aesthetic with generous whitespace
- Clean sans-serif typography
- Subtle hover animations on project cards
- Fully responsive (mobile-friendly)
- No backend needed — everything is static/frontend-only
